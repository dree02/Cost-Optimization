<h1>Linear Regression with Multiple Variables</h1> 
This repository contains a machine learning project that demonstrates the use of linear regression with multiple variables to predict home prices in Monroe, New Jersey, USA. The project focuses on predicting home prices based on three independent variables: square footage (area), number of bedrooms, and the age of the home.

Project Overview:
We tackle the problem of predicting home prices using a linear regression model. We have a dataset containing home prices in Monroe Township, New Jersey, where the price depends on the area (in square feet), the number of bedrooms, and the age of the home (in years). Our goal is to predict the prices of new homes based on these features.

We use the following equation to calculate the home price:

scss
Copy code
Price = (Area * 112.06244194) + (Bedrooms * 23388.88007794) - (Age * 3231.71790863) + 221323.00186540408
Area, Bedrooms, and Age are the independent variables or features.
Price is the dependent variable that we aim to predict.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the project:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-multiple-variables.git
Install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Download the dataset (homeprices.csv) and place it in the project directory.

Data Preprocessing
Before training the linear regression model, we perform some data preprocessing steps:

We fill any missing values in the "bedrooms" column with the median value.
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Training the Model
We use scikit-learn's linear regression implementation to train the model. The code snippet for training the model is provided in the repository.

Making Predictions
After training the model, you can make price predictions for new homes by providing the values of area, bedrooms, and age as input. Two example predictions are provided in the repository for reference.

To find the price of a home with 3000 square feet area, 3 bedrooms, and 40 years old:

python
Copy code
predicted_price = reg.predict([[3000, 3, 40]])
print(predicted_price)
To find the price of a home with 2500 square feet area, 4 bedrooms, and 5 years old:

python
Copy code
predicted_price = reg.predict([[2500, 4, 5]])
print(predicted_price)
Conclusion
This project serves as a simple example of using linear regression with multiple variables for predictive modeling. Feel free to explore the code and dataset to gain a better understanding of how linear regression can be applied to real-world problems.
